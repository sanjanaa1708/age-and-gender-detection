<h2>A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT ON AGE AND GENDER DETCETION </h2>
<h2>Objective :</h2>
<p>To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture or through webcam.</p>

<h2>About the Project :</h2>
<p>In this Python Project, Deep Learning is used to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face.  The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- 0 – 2, 4 – 6, 8 – 12, 15 – 20, 25 – 32, 38 – 43, 48 – 53, 60 – 100. It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, I made this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.</p>


 <h2>Usage :</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Download my Repository</li>
  <li>Open your Command Prompt or Terminal and change directory to the folder where all the files are present.</li>
  <li><b>Detecting Gender and Age of face in Image</b> Use Command :</li>
  
      python detect.py --image <image_name>
</ul>
  <p><b>Note: </b>The Image should be present in same folder where all the files are present</p> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Detecting Gender and Age of face through webcam</b> Use Command :</li>
  
      python detect.py
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Press <b>Ctrl + C</b> to stop the program execution.</li>
</ul>
